# React Native Templates

This repository provides a collection of React Native TypeScript templates to kickstart your mobile app development. Each template is designed for specific use cases and comes with the necessary initial configurations.

## Typescript Templates:

### 1. Blank (Pure Configuration)

The **Blank** template is a minimal setup with only the essential configurations to get you started. It's ideal for those who want to build their app from scratch and configure everything according to their needs.

### 2. Navigation

The **Navigation** template includes a basic navigation structure using React Navigation. It's a good starting point for apps that require navigation between multiple screens.

### 3. NativeWind Blank

The **NativeWind Blank** template extends the Blank template and includes NativeWind for styling. NativeWind is a utility-first CSS framework for React Native, making it easy to style your components.

### 4. NativeWind with Navigation

The **NativeWind with Navigation** template combines the NativeWind styling with a navigation setup. It's suitable for projects that need both styling and navigation out of the box.
